# Neural Network from Scratch

A deep learning framework implemented from scratch in C++ using the Eigen3 library. I developed this project to get a solid understanding of how neural networks learn via gradient descent.

## Features

- **Models**: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Layers**: Dense and activation layers (ReLU, Softmax, etc.)
- **Loss Functions**: Cross-entropy, Mean Squared Error

## Example
The framework has been tested with the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit classification.
See `main.cpp` for an example training loop.
